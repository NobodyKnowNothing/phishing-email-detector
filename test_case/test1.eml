       Less than 10% of EU aid money reaches the countries where it is most needed, 
	according to a study that found levels of assistance had dropped for the second 
	year running.

	The EU and its member states remain the biggest development donor group in the 
	world ? investing ?71.9bn ($61bn) in 2018, more than half of global aid ? but 
	its contribution was 5.8% lower than in 2017, the European NGO network, Concord, 
	found in its AidWatch report.

	Progress on meeting the UN target of spending 0.7% of gross national income 
	on aid, laid down in 1970, has gone into reverse, said the group. Their research 
	showed that aid decreased to 0.47% of the EU?s combined GNI last year, compared 
	with 0.49% in 2017 and 0.51% in 2016.

	Only Sweden, Luxembourg, Denmark and the UK met the 0.7% commitment.

	The UK?s three main political parties have committed to retaining the aid target.

	Aid from five countries ? Italy, Greece, Finland, Austria and Lithuania ? decreased 
	by 10%.

	?We are moving further away from the 2030 Agenda [for sustainable development],? 
	said Luca De Fraia of ActionAid Italy. ?Not only are we missing the target in 
	terms of quantity, but also the quality of aid is lagging behind.?

	Despite a marginal rise in aid going to the least developed countries (from 
	0.11% in 2017 to 0.12% in 2018), 16 countries, among the poorest in the world, 
	currently receive only 8% of EU funding, AidWatch found.

	?sa Thomasson, from Concord Sweden, called on EU leaders to provide more aid 
	and ensure it is used effectively to ?make the biggest difference to people 
	who are most marginalised, excluded or discriminated against and the poorest 
	and most financially challenged countries?.

	The report noted progress on what can legitimately be recorded as aid. Some 
	countries had included domestic spending on students, refugees or security in 
	official figures. But such costs ? like debt relief, interest repayments on 
	loans, or assistance ?tied? to the donor country ? are categorised as ?inflated 
	aid?, since they do not necessarily contribute to development and are often 
	funds that never leave the EU.

	This year?s report shows a 25% reduction in inflated aid, while refugee costs 
	decreased by approximately 35% and the use of aid for debt relief dropped by 
	66%.

	Jan van de Poel, policy and advocacy manager at the European Network on Debt 
	and Development, said he was concerned that the commission is overestimating 
	the potential for ?blended finance? (linking aid with loans from publicly-owned 
	institutions or commercial lenders) to help achieve the sustainable development 
	goals.

	He pointed out that, as recently as 2016, more than half of all reported contracts 
	were still awarded to firms in the donor country. ?Donors not only need to untie 
	all aid, but also make sure that their procurement practices are tailored towards 
	the private sector in developing countries,? he said.

	Claire Godfrey, interim director of policy, advocacy and research at Bond, the 
	UK development network, praised the Department for International Development 
	(DfID) for maintaining the 0.7% pledge and ensuring that the majority of its 
	aid reached the people who need it the most. She added that other EU countries 
	needed to ?step up to the plate?.

	Godfrey said DfID would ideally have oversight of all UK aid, rather than multiple 
	departments, since this would ?ensure not a single penny is diverted away from 
	the poorest, most vulnerable and most marginalised?.

	With a general election looming, Labour, the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats 
	have all stated their commitment to retaining the 0.7% aid target, equating 
	to roughly ?14bn, while the Green party said they would raise it to 1% ? in 
	line with Sweden.

	The Conservative party did not put forward a candidate for the event, but restated
